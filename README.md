> About

AttendEase is a system developed to provide a solution to the rigorous 
task of filling up forms, a way to automatically input necessary 
information within a second fast, contactless, and efficiently. A 
system that allows students and professors to track their 
attendance and a device that will replace the manual input of 
information. The system allows users to input necessary 
information for different classes and areas using a smart card.
